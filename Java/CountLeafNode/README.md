## Description

This is a program made for school in the fall of 2021. The purpose is to create a binary tree based off of the input provided and use recursion to count the number of leaf nodes in the binary tree.

The main function handles the input, the createTree function handles the tree construction, and the solution function handles the counting.

**NOTE: Only the solution function was created by me, where as the other two functions and the class Node was given as is.**
