## Description

This program was created for school in the fall of 2021. It was one of the first programs I worked on in Java and I had to overcome the lack of being able to pass by reference through function parameters that's possible in C++.
The program modularly calculates the tax an individual would have to pay based off of their relationship status and the tax rates.
