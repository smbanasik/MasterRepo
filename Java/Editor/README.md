## Description

This program was created for school in the fall of 2021. It utilizes another school assignment called MyImplementations.
The purpose of the assignment is to creat an editor object that is capable of making additions, deletions, and replacements.
It contains saving, moving the cursor, and an undo stack and a redo stack. The undo and redo stacks utilize an array list from MyImplementations to contain a stack of actions that can be undone or redone.
