## Description

This is a school project made in the summer of 2021. The program reads in a series of accounts from a file called InfoBankAccounts.txt, and global settings from InfoBankConfig.txt.
From there, it recieves a series of instructions from InfoBankAccountsTransactions.txt. It then performs the transactions listed.

The program made use of classes to differentiate between accounts. BankAccounts class is the parent of the checking accounts class, and savings account class. Interest checking accounts inherits from the checking accounts class.
The transactions class handles parsing through the information found in InfoBankAccountsTransactions.
