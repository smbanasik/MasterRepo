## Description

This is a school program made in the summer of 2021. The program was designed to simulate low memeory conditions, so a union had to be used.

The program reads in data from the inputDataAntenna.txt. There are two types of data, status information and experiment information. The data inputted contains an information type, and then the data corresponding to that information type.

The satellite can only hold 5 values at a time, so the values are stored in the array in a circular fashion, overwriting old values with new ones.
