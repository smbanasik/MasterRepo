## Description

This is an incomplete personal project that was started in August of 2021. The program is intended to be a turn based RPG game that is entirely text based through the console.

The program features a player character with abilities fighting three enemy goblins. There's multiple moves, each intended to provide additional depth to the systems.
This program was my first dive into using the STL, specifically utilizing the vector container.
I eventually lost interest in this project when I discovered the SDL library, a third party library capabile of graphics and keyboard inputs. If I did return to this project I would refactor a lot of my code, starting with moving most of the functions in main to their own class.
